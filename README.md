# linAlgebra

A very basic linear algebra library written in JavaScript with no dependencies.
This is mostly a learning exercise in linear algebra for myself.

## Getting Started:
1. ```git clone``` this repository
2. ```cd linAlgebra``` 
3. ```npm install```
4. ```npm test``` to verify all of the tests pass.
